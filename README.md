# DogApp
The purpose of this Tamagotchi application is to take care of a virtual dog named Rocky. This type of virtual pet software is especially popular with kids. Apps like this one show an animated animal on the screen that reacts to behaviors like feeding, cleaning, and playing. Parents frequently encourage their children to use these applications because they are nonviolent, entertaining, and foster a sense of responsibility. Additionally, virtual pet apps use the full power of smartphones and tablets. Real pets require care and attention, and they sometimes get filthy. If you're too busy for a real pet, a virtual pet app can be an excellent substitute. Like any other animal, "Rocky" requires cleaning and feeding. The main distinction is how much simpler it is to automate these tasks. These updated virtual pet apps are enjoyable for many adults who grew up with Tamagotchis in the nineties. It is similar to experiencing the pleasure of taking care of a virtual pet through a journey down memory lane. These apps appeal to a wide variety of consumers because of their familiarity and nostalgia.
I used two projects to make this app in one application, my main activity was my “Get Start” screen, you had to click the button, and an action was performed by taking you to another screen, the second project which is called “My Pet Activity”, there is where most of the action is performed, the “Feed” button which once is clicked an action on the picture is displayed of a dog eating and once the picture is displayed it will say in the textview “No” next to “Hungry”, it is indicating that the dog is not hungry, we another button that says “Clean” which once is clicked an action of a dog being cleaned is being displayed, and when it is clicked, in the textview it gives a rating out of 10 of how clean the dog is, 10 being the cleanest and lastly we have our button ”Play”, which is the dogs health, in another textview next to “Health” it gives a rating out of 10 on how healthy the dog is. I used the colour purple for the base of my app, to give it a warm feeling and exciting feeling. I made my default screen the welcome screen which is the first screen after you press the “Get Started" button.
I used the same font for all three of my “Feed”, “Clean” and “Play” buttons called “chewy”. For my “Get Started” button I used the font “slackey”. In my textview I used the colour green for my pet's feedback because, in my case, green always means good.
Teams are encouraged to collaborate in real-time using GitHub's web-based interface. It functions similarly to a shared code folder where team members can view the most recent version and make public edits1. 
By collaborating on a single project, developers can cut down on redundant work. If necessary, they can also just go back to earlier iterations. GitHub kept track of every change I made to my code files.
